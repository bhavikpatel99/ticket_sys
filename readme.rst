What is Ticket Management System
###################

The Ticket Management System is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the process of assigning and tracking tasks or issues within an organization. It allows supervisors or managers to assign tickets, which can represent tasks, support requests, or any other type of work item, to employees or team members. The system provides a centralized platform where tickets can be created, assigned, prioritized, and tracked throughout their lifecycle. By using a Ticket Management System, bosses can efficiently assign tickets to employees, ensuring that tasks are properly allocated and progress can be monitored effectively.
